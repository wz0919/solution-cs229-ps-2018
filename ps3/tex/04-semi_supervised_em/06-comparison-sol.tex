\begin{answer}
    \begin{enumerate}
\item The needed number of iterations for semi-supervised EM is far less than unsupervised EM.
\item For unsupervised EM, the clusters change for every random initialization. While for semi-supervised EM, the clusters are same.
\item As shown in the figure, unsupervised EM takes two Gaussian to have high-variance, which is wrong. This is probably because high-variance will introduce more noise to the low-variance clusters. While for semi-supervised Gaussian, the results are quite accurate, with only one Gaussian that has high-variance.
