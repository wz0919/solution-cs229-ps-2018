\begin{answer}
Since $ \theta^Tx $ is convex, we only need to proof that $ l(\eta)=-\log\{b(y)\exp(\eta y -a(\eta))\} $ is convex. This holds by
\[ \frac{\partial l}{\partial \eta}=- y + a'(\eta)\Rightarrow \frac{\partial l}{\partial \eta^2} = a''(\eta) = \mbox{Var}(Y;\eta)\geq 0 \]
So $l(\theta)$ is convex.
